# Cat Community Manager

To get things running after pulling in the repo, first run the following command:
`npm install`

Once this has completed, you should have the relevant packages installed in your node_modules folder (this is currently ignore in git using .gitignore to keep the repo smaller)

To get the server running, simply run the command:
`npm start`

This should get the server running on http://localhost:3000 (we will adjust that for product purposes, but for now this is how to run and test it in development).
